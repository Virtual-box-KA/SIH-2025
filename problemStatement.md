**Al-Based Rockfall Prediction and Alert System for Open-Pit Mines.**<br>
**Category - Software**<br>
**Organization - Ministry of Mines**

Background

Rockfalls in open-pit mines pose a significant threat to both personnel and equipment, often resulting in serious injuries, operational delays, and financial loss. Traditional rockfall detection systems rely on visual inspection or expensive proprietary solutions, which are either labor-intensive or lack real-time predictive capabilities. With the increasing use of digital monitoring and AI, there is a pressing need to integrate predictive analytics into slope stability assessments for proactive decision-making.

Description

This problem invites participants to design a smart, AI-based system capable of predicting potential rockfall incidents in open-pit mines. The system should process multi-source data inputs including:
- Digital Elevation Models (DEM)
- Drone-captured imagery
- Geotechnical sensor data (displacement, strain, pore pressure)
- Environmental factors (rainfall, temperature, vibrations)

Machine learning models should identify patterns that precede rockfall events. The system must feature a user-friendly dashboard for mine planners, along with:
- Real-time risk maps
- Probability-based forecasts
- Alert mechanisms (via SMS/email)
Integration with low-cost monitoring hardware would be an added advantage.

Expected Solution

- A machine learning model trained on real or synthetic data to predict rockfall risks.
- A web/mobile-based dashboard for visualization of vulnerable zones.
- Real-time alert generation with suggested action plans.
- Open-source integration possibilities for scale and customization.

Impact

The solution should be cost-effective, scalable for different mine sites, and adaptable for both public and private mining operations, enabling safer and more resilient mining practices.
